# Kyoto Night NeoVim / Vim theme

Colorscheme inspired by [[https://github.com/enkia/enki-theme][Enki Theme]] variant Tokyo Night.

I'm aware that there already is a [[https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim][Tokyo Night Vim theme]], but I find it a little too flashy.

So, I decided to make my own, that would be closer to Enki's Sublime Theme, and easier for the eyes.

The theme's code is based on [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim][Nord Theme]].
